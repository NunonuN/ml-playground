# ML Playground 🧠

A collection of hands-on machine learning exercises, Jupyter notebooks, and
practical examples covering core concepts from data preprocessing to model
evaluation.

## 📖 Contents

- **Notebooks**: step-by-step implementations of classic ML algorithms.
- **Exercises**: practice problems with solutions.
- **Data sets**: mock and real-world data for experimentation.
- **Tutorials**: from beginner concepts to intermediate techniques.

## 🚀 Quick start

1. Clone the repo:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NunonuN/ml-playground.git
    cd ml-playground
    ```

2. Open Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    or open any notebook in VSCode/VSCodium (you will have to install the
    **Jupyter** extension, in this case).

## 📚 Topics covered

- 📈 Supervised learning (regression, classification).
- 🎯 Model evaluation & validation.
- 🔍 Unsupervised learning (clustering, PCA, and others).
- ⚙️ Hyperparameter tuning.
- 📊 Data preprocessing & feature engineering.
